	Hi, my name is Filippo Pensalfini and I am a software developer and architect.
</p>
<p>
	When I came to Germany after getting my B.Sc. in my native country, Italy, I immediately realized two things. First, that German gave me headaches: I wasn't really proficient at the time, and every day I came back from work my brain was steaming. Second, while I enjoy developing software, I sucked at it. Then I decided to get better, now I can survive in Germany without pains and I managed to tame a decent amount of wild code, but alas, much more code is out there in dare need to be tamed. 
</p>
<p>
	I like languages, both natural and programming ones, and enjoy reading, playing videogames, martial arts, dancing and engaging with passionate people.
